download.py——利用getip得到的代理服务器ip，重对request函数进行后改良，添加代理功能

update 4月20号 —— upload spider 3.0 ——即日起更新用英语，显得高大尚，hhhhhhh

1.select lots of crawling code encapsulated as a class in paqu.py file to make main code cleaner

2.add paqu.py encapsulated code as a Spider() class

3.add Novel_Type ENUM and Novel_Info ENUM to make code more understanding

4.add multithreading to crawl the www.quanshuwang.com

5.add save_pic function

     can save all novel pictures in the path

     every novel has its own folder to save pictures(now just save pictures...)
  
6.get information return a list, is easy to add the connect mysql function

※A Dangerious Bug——crawd 1,2,3,4,6 page, novels with repetition ,maybe novel_url has some issues.

4月22号——预计将提取的数据存储到mysql中 并设计mysql库

April 23rd

I'm sorry to late for update the file

Because there are some issues in my own computer.

I ghost my computer, all my work environment applications are lost... Make me cry for five seconds. .

Now I finish my own first beyond one thousand lines project.

Let me say what I update:

First:Add error handling

     In spider3.0, all the function has no error handling. 
     
     And make me carry because of adding the mysql function. 
     
     Always said something wrong with the project and can't write in mysql. 
     
     So I add lots of error handling, and the paqu.py beyond 400 lines, Brilliant! 
     
     Finally I find it's a proxy server problem! What the ***

Second:A big problem

     In spider3.0, I just show the novel the latest novel content, 
     
     All right it's my question,
     
     So I crawl the whole novel.

Third: My pride——Saving all novel information in Mysql

if you want to run and see:

1.Mysql, Please setup The authority application, I setup a piracy and always said 99 errors 
when I use multithreading to crawl.

2.Configure the mysql information:  

       host 	= "localhost"

       port 	= 3306

       user 	= "root"

       passwd 	= ""

       db   	= "novel_information_list"

       charset 	= "utf8"(dot write "utf-8", this error I find 3 hours...)

※Well, you can configure anything you like, don't forget to revise the paqu.py code

3.Create table

     |——eleven chapter_(type_num)_list tables.for Example: chapter_1_list

     `——one novel_information_list table.

novel_informtaion_list:

    novel_id  (type = char, len=8, Not NULL, PRIMARY, Default 10000) 

    type      (type = shortint, len=2)

    novel_name(type = varchar, len 64)

    serialize (type = tinyint, len 1)

    author    (type = varchar, len=60)

    summary   (type = varchar, len=255)(I forget to code it, Forgive it)

chapter_(type_num)_list:

     novel_id          (type = int, len = 11(whatever it's ok to enough), NOT ULL, PRIMARY)

     novel_name        (type = varchar, len = 50)

     novel_chapter_name(type = varchar, len = 50)

     chapter_content   (type = longtext)
